	//About SEI Content

	'Like the smooth shining surface of water.'=>'',
	'The SEI professional glass coating series, created in collaboration with a Japanese chemical business, gives a superb mirror-like finish that is long lasting and perfect for a variety of settings and will make your car stand out with its elegant shine.'=>'',
	'This product comes with certain proof in snow country.'=>'',
	'We at (Irios) Niigata have more than 20 years of expertise in the fields of glass coating technology and auto cleaning. Customer satisfaction has allowed us to repeatedly demonstrate our worth. Niigata Prefecture is one of the snowiest regions in Japan. Our success in building the SEI product in this challenging setting has resulted in a high-quality and reliable solution that we can now offer to elevate the appearance of your automobile.'=>'',
	'A long lasting beautiful shine.'=>'',
	'This inorganic glass membrane has remarkable antifouling qualities. It has a high level of resistance to organic substances like hand oil, bird excrement, insect stings, and other comparable materials. They are effortlessly removed by water. Moreover, it is very resistant to acid, corrosion, and water stains. Also shielded from heat, harsh chemicals, and UV radiation is the long-lasting shine.'=>'',
	'STRENGTH STABILITY'=>'',
	'With this combination of flexibility and strength against impact, the coating wont shatter even after the hardening process. Bound in the strength of the surface, it has a hardness of 7-9H. It is also simple to keep this strength.'=>'',
	'TWO TYPES OF APPLICATION AND FINISH'=>'',
	'Forming of the smooth strong surface once the hardening is complete will keep at the maximum hardness at 7H. Strong against scratching and dirt and keep that beautiful finish on the body. There is minimal burden on the paintwork, human body and environment. Its all rounded and flexible ability gives the ultimum texture and hardness which makes it able to be applied in the thorough way. The polished body reflects a brilliant sight. It will look like your car is shining like a crystal lake. Even under the brightest sun or snow blizzard. This is an ideal coating for any environment. With the help of a Japanese chemical company we have created a professional glass coating series called SEI. Strong quality and a delicate gloss. With these two elements combined we offer a beautiful finish. With such an elegant shine you will stand out from the crowd! You will be someone to envy.'=>'',

	'SEI 3001 Series: Notes on Construction and Precautions' =>'',
	'If you are going to construct the SEI series, we have compiled some notes and precautions for you. Below is some supplementary information as a manual.' => '',
	'Temperature Management' =>'',
	'The curing characteristic of SEI 3000 series is based on an ambient temperature of 25°C.'=>'',
	'The higher the temperature, the faster the curing process will be, and the lower the temperature, the slower it will be.'=>'',
	'Temperature rise is effective in accelerating the curing process, but be sure not to let the humidity drop too much at the same time.'=>'',
	'Temperature management before handing over the vehicle to the customer is particularly important during the cold season.'=>'',
	'The change in hardness and water repellency is proportional (as the hardness increases, the water repellency also increases).'=>'',
	'For more details, please refer to the "Supplementary Information on Temperature Characteristics".'=>'',
	'Condensation and Water Damage'=>'',
	'SEI 3000 series cures by reacting with moisture in the air.' => '',
	'At an ambient temperature of 25°C, it is strictly prohibited to have water, including condensation, for at least 24 hours.' => '',
	'Water damage during curing can cause uneven curing reactions, resulting in unevenness and whitening.' => '',
	'Even if there is a roof, condensation is more likely to occur outdoors when mist occurs.' => '',
	'(Reference) Using a cloth that contains water when wiping is only for making the work easier. It is not for curing. You can use a dry cloth from the first wiping depending on your work feeling.'=>'',
	'Use of Spray Gun'=>'',
	'SEI 3001 series, which is based on low-molecular silane, is recommended for hand application, and there is no need to use a spray gun like traditional high-molecular coating materials.'=>'',
	'If you use a spray gun to spray, be sure to pay attention to the following two points'=>'',
	'Always wipe after spraying'=>'',
	'Spraying can generate flammable gas, which can cause explosions or fires.'=>'',
	'If the temperature environment is severe, such as during cold weather, and conditions are difficult to meet before handing over to the customer, it is effective to use SEI 3000 series as a topcoat for water repellency and water stain prevention.'=>'',
	'For more details, please refer to the "Supplementary Information on Temperature Characteristics".'=>'',


	//3001 Product
	'SEI 3031' => '',
	'SEI 3031 is a 4-functional group oligomer glass coating protection with high workability and stress resistance. It pursues a balance of crack resistance, flexibility, and hardness, resulting in a strong and flexible coating with excellent application properties. The curing speed is optimized for easy handling with alcohol-based solvents, and stable quality is ensured by using high-quality raw materials produced in Japan, which is a source of pride worldwide. The coating surface is firmly bonded with a hard and flexible inorganic glass film with organic functional groups that provide anti-fouling properties. The oligomer coupling agent used is easy to handle and safe. Due to its small molecular size (4-functional group oligomer), the coating has strong adhesion with the coating surface, resulting in a long life cycle. Additionally, it is less likely to experience stress-related cracks from impacts or bending.' =>'',
	'Since it is difficult for organic matter such as pitch, tar, bird droppings, handprints, dust, and dirt to adhere to the coating surface, it can be easily washed away with water. The inorganic glass backbone with organic functional group side chains makes it difficult for acids to cause corrosion or silica (water spots, ion deposits) to adhere. It is highly resistant to UV rays, heat, oil, water, and chemicals, making it suitable for long-term protection of painted surfaces. The alcohol-based solvent is friendly to the painted surface, human body, and the environment. The optimized curing speed ensures comfortable workability, with the coating beginning to harden in 20 minutes in winter and 10 minutes in summer. After 24 hours, the hardness is 2H, and after 7 days, it is 7H.' => '',


	//T21 Product

	'SEI T21' => '',
	'The coupling technology "SILICONE ALKOXY OLIGOMER" offers solvent-free surface protection with a rich and smooth finish, making application easy. Silex4F is a glass component with the highest concentration of 4 functional groups that provides flexible strength, crack resistance, and a balance of hardness and flexibility. Despite being solvent-free, it is easy to apply and wipe, with stable quality and supply from Japan. The coating forms an inorganic glass film with a strong bond to the painted surface, providing both hardness and flexibility. The small molecule size (4 functional group oligomer) and cross-linking enhance the bond strength between the coating surface and the substrate, resulting in a long life cycle.' => '',
	'As it is difficult to bond with organic dirt and stains, it is easy to wash off oil, tar, bird droppings, handprints, dust, and other contaminants with water. The inorganic glass backbone and organic functional side-chain structure make it difficult for corrosion and inorganic dirt (water spots, ion deposits) to adhere. It provides long-term protection for painted surfaces with high resistance to UV rays, heat, oil, water, and chemicals. It is an alcohol-based solvent, which is gentle on painted surfaces, the human body, and the environment. The optimized curing rate ensures comfortable workability. It begins to harden in 20 minutes during winter and 10 minutes during summer, reaching a hardness of 2H after 24 hours and 7H after 7 days.' => '',
